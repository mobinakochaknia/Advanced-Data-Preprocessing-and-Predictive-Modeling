Otherwise, we will continue to see increased violence that is being blamed on pro-Trump supporters in the media Anti-Trump activists who protested his planned appearance in Arizona today by blocking a limited access highway and creating a  traffic nightmare  with  cars backed up for miles  [N.Y. Daily News] could be sued in class action law suits for massive damages modeled after suits filed against those who similarly illegally blocked traffic at the George Washington Bridge, and judgments against other illegal protesters, says public interest law professor John Banzhaf.With the mainstream media continuing to blame Trump supporters for the efforts of their opponents to shut down their free speech rights, it may be time to adopt the tactics the left favors to get its way: lawsuits. That s the suggestion of John Banzhaf, a George Washington University law professor who defies categorization politically but is often labeled a  gadfly.   He explains:Anti-Trumpers Block Highway; Face Class Actions For DamagesSuits Filed re Blocked GW Bridge Provide Precedenthttps://t.co/LN17FGakCw  John Banzhaf (@ProfBanzhaf) March 19, 2016Why and How to Sue Anti-Trump Protesters and Other Disruptors\\\"Sue The Disruptors\\\" More Effective Than Criminal Lawhttps://t.co/9MMiZtE5wq  John Banzhaf (@ProfBanzhaf) March 21, 2016As Banzhaf had predicted and later helped inspire, two different class action law suits seeking millions in civil damages were brought by persons stuck in the massive traffic jams at NYC s GW Bridge which were illegally caused by former aides to Governor Chris Christie.Suing protesters    Suing the Bastards    may be the most effective way to help deter illegal protests, says Banzhaf, noting that slap-on-the-wrist criminal fines usually aren t very effective, especially since it sometimes also helps give illegal protesters a soap box to air their grievances in criminal trials.The lead protester who chained her neck to a pickup truck was George Soros paid operative, Jacinta Gonzalez from New Orleans.But the tide may already be turning, says Banzhaf, citing these examples.When other groups see that the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has been forced to pay $2.55 million to Japanese companies for illegally using acid and smoke bombs to disrupt their whaling, they may think twice before blocking traffic to advance their agenda, says Banzhaf, who has promoted the idea   and the very slogan   of  Suing the Bastards  when the law is broken.In another example, a student who illegally chained himself to some construction equipment because he opposed an oil pipeline was forced to pay out big bucks for his criminal conduct.As NPR reported it, he was apparently ready to accept a relatively painless conviction for trespass, but not to pay the pipeline company $39,000 in restitution.Similarly, eleven protesters who allegedly engaged in illegal activities at the Mall of American are facing restitution claims from the City of Bloomington.In these and many similar situations, protesters are often willing to accept a small misdemeanor fine and conviction for a chance to focus attention on their cause, especially if it means they get to have a criminal trial which generates even more publicity for them and for their grievance, argues Banzhaf.While most of these actions against criminal protesters have been brought by businesses, there s no reason why similar legal actions cannot also be brought by any person falsely imprisoned on that Arizona highway   as was the case with one of the two GW-Bridge suits.Using the threat of legal actions is a far better and more American way of deterring illegal protests than engaging in physical violence against them, as some Trump supporters have apparently already done, says Banzhaf.Via: PRLOG\",\n          \"The announcement that Harriet Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill came as little surprise to most, who celebrated progress with a show of support for a truly amazing woman. If you live in the insane, historically inaccurate world of the modern right, you heard a different story altogether; one of the evils of the  Democrat Party  and how their founder tried to stop the gun-toting, Republican abolitionist, Harriet Tubman.Yes, that really is the lie they re spinning. It seems that in most cases of Republicans losing someone they fiercely admired they tend to go back to the time of Lincoln when the men were men and Northerners were Republicans. It really is that easy to understand, yet conservatives just don t get it. In the time leading up to the Civil War, northern progressives like Abraham Lincoln were in the process of forming a very different Republican party than the one we know today. The Southerners fought, seceded, lost, spent a good deal of time living with their humiliation and moved on, content to stick together as Democrats.And that doesn t seem strange to these people? It doesn t seem odd that the Republicans who abolished slavery, wrote the 13th and 14th Amendments and stood side by side with women until they could vote were predominately Northern progressive liberals? Andrew Jackson was the president who saw the beginning of the Democratic party and he was a slave owner from the South. That doesn t seem a little odd?We re talking about Harriet Tubman here. The woman was armed because she lived in fear for her life and for the lives of those she helped. She didn t belong to a political party, since as a black woman during slavery she wouldn t have been able to vote for several reasons. To call her a champion of the Republican party would be like trying to claim that Lincoln himself would be a proud card-carrying member today. Yeah, I know they claim that all the time.You can read the ridiculous claim, which is basically a 2 paragraph propaganda piece circulating among such reputable publications as Alan B West s Site. Fox News hasn t picked it up yet, but the comments on one of their local affiliates who reported the story say it all:That s just the tip of the iceberg. People sure do love to make things up online:How about some conspiracy? The president naturally spends much of his day thinking of ways to screw over Americans, that s how much he hates us:And good golly the cost. New 20s that were going to be printed need to be printed. Maybe we should add that to a conversation about how little the average Republican knows about the budget.Numerous people have also been to the thread to let them know that the Republican party officially became the party of southern regressive morons the day Strom Thurmond jumped ship and joined. Your first political move? Defraud and disenfranchise as many voters as possible across the South running on what we now know as the  Southern Dixiecrat strategy. Then, as Republicans, you shot down the ERA, tried in vain to kill the Civil Rights Movement, created the Moral Majority, The Tea Party and The Freedom Caucus and stocked them with religious zealots just to brighten our day. You re also responsible for the rise of Donald Trump.The bottom line? You don t get to claim Harriet Tubman as one of yours and you certainly don t get to stick us with Andrew Jackson. As a Northern progressive, my great, great, great-grandfather lived on the happy end of the underground railroad, no matter who he voted for in 1862. Stop trying to rewrite history and move along.Featured image via abc7.com/Facebook\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe on Tuesday vetoed a bill that would have blocked funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions and other health services. The bill passed by the Republican-controlled legislature would have barred the state from providing funds to clinics that perform abortions not covered by Medicaid, the federal healthcare program for the poor. McAuliffe, a Democrat, said the measure would harm thousands of Virginians who relied on Planned Parenthood healthcare services and programs. He vetoed a similar measure last year. \\u201cAttempts to restrict women\\u2019s access to health care will impede the goal of making Virginia the best place to live, work, and run a business,\\u201d he said in a statement. Advocates for the law had said it would underpin organizations that provide the widest range of services. Planned Parenthood draws the ire of many Republicans because it provides abortions. Republican President Donald Trump has pledged to defund the organization. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"left-news\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2184,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"May 24, 2016 \",\n          \"Feb 10, 2017\",\n          \"September 19, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lable\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Real\",\n          \"Fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lable_num\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1\",\n          \"0\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Otherwise, we will continue to see increased violence that is being blamed on pro-Trump supporters in the media Anti-Trump activists who protested his planned appearance in Arizona today by blocking a limited access highway and creating a  traffic nightmare  with  cars backed up for miles  [N.Y. Daily News] could be sued in class action law suits for massive damages modeled after suits filed against those who similarly illegally blocked traffic at the George Washington Bridge, and judgments against other illegal protesters, says public interest law professor John Banzhaf.With the mainstream media continuing to blame Trump supporters for the efforts of their opponents to shut down their free speech rights, it may be time to adopt the tactics the left favors to get its way: lawsuits. That s the suggestion of John Banzhaf, a George Washington University law professor who defies categorization politically but is often labeled a  gadfly.   He explains:Anti-Trumpers Block Highway; Face Class Actions For DamagesSuits Filed re Blocked GW Bridge Provide Precedenthttps://t.co/LN17FGakCw  John Banzhaf (@ProfBanzhaf) March 19, 2016Why and How to Sue Anti-Trump Protesters and Other Disruptors\\\"Sue The Disruptors\\\" More Effective Than Criminal Lawhttps://t.co/9MMiZtE5wq  John Banzhaf (@ProfBanzhaf) March 21, 2016As Banzhaf had predicted and later helped inspire, two different class action law suits seeking millions in civil damages were brought by persons stuck in the massive traffic jams at NYC s GW Bridge which were illegally caused by former aides to Governor Chris Christie.Suing protesters    Suing the Bastards    may be the most effective way to help deter illegal protests, says Banzhaf, noting that slap-on-the-wrist criminal fines usually aren t very effective, especially since it sometimes also helps give illegal protesters a soap box to air their grievances in criminal trials.The lead protester who chained her neck to a pickup truck was George Soros paid operative, Jacinta Gonzalez from New Orleans.But the tide may already be turning, says Banzhaf, citing these examples.When other groups see that the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has been forced to pay $2.55 million to Japanese companies for illegally using acid and smoke bombs to disrupt their whaling, they may think twice before blocking traffic to advance their agenda, says Banzhaf, who has promoted the idea   and the very slogan   of  Suing the Bastards  when the law is broken.In another example, a student who illegally chained himself to some construction equipment because he opposed an oil pipeline was forced to pay out big bucks for his criminal conduct.As NPR reported it, he was apparently ready to accept a relatively painless conviction for trespass, but not to pay the pipeline company $39,000 in restitution.Similarly, eleven protesters who allegedly engaged in illegal activities at the Mall of American are facing restitution claims from the City of Bloomington.In these and many similar situations, protesters are often willing to accept a small misdemeanor fine and conviction for a chance to focus attention on their cause, especially if it means they get to have a criminal trial which generates even more publicity for them and for their grievance, argues Banzhaf.While most of these actions against criminal protesters have been brought by businesses, there s no reason why similar legal actions cannot also be brought by any person falsely imprisoned on that Arizona highway   as was the case with one of the two GW-Bridge suits.Using the threat of legal actions is a far better and more American way of deterring illegal protests than engaging in physical violence against them, as some Trump supporters have apparently already done, says Banzhaf.Via: PRLOG\",\n          \"The announcement that Harriet Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill came as little surprise to most, who celebrated progress with a show of support for a truly amazing woman. If you live in the insane, historically inaccurate world of the modern right, you heard a different story altogether; one of the evils of the  Democrat Party  and how their founder tried to stop the gun-toting, Republican abolitionist, Harriet Tubman.Yes, that really is the lie they re spinning. It seems that in most cases of Republicans losing someone they fiercely admired they tend to go back to the time of Lincoln when the men were men and Northerners were Republicans. It really is that easy to understand, yet conservatives just don t get it. In the time leading up to the Civil War, northern progressives like Abraham Lincoln were in the process of forming a very different Republican party than the one we know today. The Southerners fought, seceded, lost, spent a good deal of time living with their humiliation and moved on, content to stick together as Democrats.And that doesn t seem strange to these people? It doesn t seem odd that the Republicans who abolished slavery, wrote the 13th and 14th Amendments and stood side by side with women until they could vote were predominately Northern progressive liberals? Andrew Jackson was the president who saw the beginning of the Democratic party and he was a slave owner from the South. That doesn t seem a little odd?We re talking about Harriet Tubman here. The woman was armed because she lived in fear for her life and for the lives of those she helped. She didn t belong to a political party, since as a black woman during slavery she wouldn t have been able to vote for several reasons. To call her a champion of the Republican party would be like trying to claim that Lincoln himself would be a proud card-carrying member today. Yeah, I know they claim that all the time.You can read the ridiculous claim, which is basically a 2 paragraph propaganda piece circulating among such reputable publications as Alan B West s Site. Fox News hasn t picked it up yet, but the comments on one of their local affiliates who reported the story say it all:That s just the tip of the iceberg. People sure do love to make things up online:How about some conspiracy? The president naturally spends much of his day thinking of ways to screw over Americans, that s how much he hates us:And good golly the cost. New 20s that were going to be printed need to be printed. Maybe we should add that to a conversation about how little the average Republican knows about the budget.Numerous people have also been to the thread to let them know that the Republican party officially became the party of southern regressive morons the day Strom Thurmond jumped ship and joined. Your first political move? Defraud and disenfranchise as many voters as possible across the South running on what we now know as the  Southern Dixiecrat strategy. Then, as Republicans, you shot down the ERA, tried in vain to kill the Civil Rights Movement, created the Moral Majority, The Tea Party and The Freedom Caucus and stocked them with religious zealots just to brighten our day. You re also responsible for the rise of Donald Trump.The bottom line? You don t get to claim Harriet Tubman as one of yours and you certainly don t get to stick us with Andrew Jackson. As a Northern progressive, my great, great, great-grandfather lived on the happy end of the underground railroad, no matter who he voted for in 1862. Stop trying to rewrite history and move along.Featured image via abc7.com/Facebook\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe on Tuesday vetoed a bill that would have blocked funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions and other health services. The bill passed by the Republican-controlled legislature would have barred the state from providing funds to clinics that perform abortions not covered by Medicaid, the federal healthcare program for the poor. McAuliffe, a Democrat, said the measure would harm thousands of Virginians who relied on Planned Parenthood healthcare services and programs. He vetoed a similar measure last year. \\u201cAttempts to restrict women\\u2019s access to health care will impede the goal of making Virginia the best place to live, work, and run a business,\\u201d he said in a statement. Advocates for the law had said it would underpin organizations that provide the widest range of services. Planned Parenthood draws the ire of many Republicans because it provides abortions. Republican President Donald Trump has pledged to defund the organization. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"left-news\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2184,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"May 24, 2016 \",\n          \"Feb 10, 2017\",\n          \"September 19, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lable\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Real\",\n          \"Fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lable_num\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1\",\n          \"0\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"preprocessed_txt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9601,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Americans well start fight people shut public road hit thug hurt wallet continue increase violence blame pro trump supporter medium anti trump activist protest plan appearance Arizona today block limited access highway create   traffic nightmare     car back mile   N.Y.
