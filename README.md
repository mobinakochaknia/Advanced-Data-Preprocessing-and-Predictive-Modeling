## Usage

To run the code, use the following command:
you can download the data set and open code in google colb or .. .that's how easy it is

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the entire process.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset.
- `models/`: Directory to save trained models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and experiments.

## Data Preprocessing

The code handles data preprocessing, including:
- Loading the dataset using `pandas`.
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Normalizing numerical features.

## Model Building

A neural network model is built using `tensorflow` and `keras`. The architecture includes multiple layers with specified neurons and activation functions.

## Training and Evaluation

The model is trained on the training dataset with the following steps:
- Specifying the loss function, optimizer, and metrics.
- Evaluating the model on the test dataset to calculate accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Making Predictions

The trained model is used to make predictions on new data. The results are visualized using `matplotlib`.

## Algorithms and Techniques

The following algorithms and techniques are used in this project:
- **Neural Networks**: A type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain, used for tasks like classification and regression.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- **Train-Test Split**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the model's performance.
